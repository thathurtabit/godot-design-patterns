## About These Tools

These code organization tools were created to help Godot C# developers maintain
consistent, readable, and well-organized codebases. The tools are designed to:

- Automatically organize C# class members according to a standardized pattern
- Preserve Godot-specific attributes and syntax ([Export], [Signal], etc.)
- Provide safe, reversible operations with automatic backups
- Support both interactive and automated workflows
- Be easily customizable for different project structures

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This project benefits from the diverse needs of the
Godot community. Common areas for improvement include:

- Support for additional C# language features
- Integration with more development workflows
- Enhanced Godot-specific handling
- Performance optimizations
- Better error handling and user feedback

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the Godot community for their continuous efforts in making game
development accessible and enjoyable for developers worldwide.
